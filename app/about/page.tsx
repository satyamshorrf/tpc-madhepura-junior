              Unlike the Avengers origin story, 2 people: Satyam and Rajesh thought of creating this little group of
              intellectuals so that online college would be a bit more fun than the usual drab lectures. And guys, we
              are glad they thought of doing so. Gradually, others started to join in: Prabhash, Sekh Sanam, Kajal,
              Pratik, Sonu, Kajal, Sumit, and Aditya, and thus began the journey of the Decodians, and to be honest, it
              is quite a privilege to be a part of this little family that we have here, where we look after one
              another.
